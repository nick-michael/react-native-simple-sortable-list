# react-native-simple-sortable-list
A feature stripped, sortable, drag and drop, vertical list for React Native.

**[Forked from [react-native-sortable-list](https://github.com/gitim/react-native-sortable-list) ]**
Firstly, I would like to thank all the contributors of the original package.

I have heavily optimised state and animation management for a much more performant package. I have also stripped out features (horizontal list and 'footer') - at least temporarily.

This project is in VERY early stages at the current time, and I will be looking to tidy up code, re-implement features, and move over to FlatList in the near future.
